A simple recreation of the Atari game Breakout written in Javascript and HTML, following the MDN tutorial.

Just load index.html into the browser and control your paddle with either the mouse (my recommendation) or the arrow keys.

If you get ten bricks, you gain a life.

Every 56 points (or two levels) the ball speed increases by 1.

Usually, I can't get past the first level.

Enjoy!
