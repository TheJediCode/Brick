A simple recreation of the Atari game Breakout written in Javascript and HTML, following the MDN tutorial.

Just load index.html into the browser and control your paddle with either the mouse (my recommendation) or the arrow keys.

Currently does not include high scores, but I'm working on figuring out how to store that information in the browser that maintains it after reload.

Either that or I have to figure out a way to rerun the JS code without reloading the entire document.

If you get ten bricks, you gain a life.
Enjoy!
